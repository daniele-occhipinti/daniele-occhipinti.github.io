Hi. My name is Daniele Occhipinti

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 and I am looking for my next new role.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
I have a masterâ€™s degree in electronic engineering

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.000
and spent 15 years living and working in London.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
During the last 5 years I was working for the British Government,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
leading the digital transformation of the services for citizens.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There, not only was I able to deliver projects successfully,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but I was also responsible for managing people, leading and growing teams and auditing new services.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I believe I am good at building relationships, thinking strategically and making things happen.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.500
I am based in Genova, Italy, and I am willing to travel.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well, I am looking forward to hearing from you so that we can discuss how I can help your organisation achieve its goals.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Thanks for your attention.
